This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
##Loading and preprocessing the data##

```{r echo=TRUE}

unzip("activity.zip",exdir=".")
activity <-read.csv("activity.csv")


```
##Claculate the mean of total number of steps taken per day##
###1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day###

```{r echo=TRUE,results='asis'}

step_sum <-with(activity,tapply(activity[,1],activity[,2],sum,na.rm=T))

```
###2.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day###

```{r echo=TRUE}

step_df <-data.frame(step_sum)
total_steps_bydate <-(step_df[,1])


hist(total_steps_bydate)

```

Figure 1  Total number of stepstaken each day. 

###3.Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day###

```{r echo=TRUE}

summary(total_steps_bydate)

```
##Analysis the daily activity pattern##
### 1.Calculate averaged step for every 5-minute interval across all days. ###
First, we rearrange the data file by interval ascending using dplyr package. Then we summary the data file with group of interval value

```{r }
library(dplyr)
```

```{r echo=TRUE}

act_byinterval <-arrange(activity,interval)
sum_byint <-with(act_byinterval,tapply(act_byinterval[,1],activity[,3],sum,na.rm=T))
total_steps_byint <-data.frame(sum_byint)

```
By now, we have total number of steps for each 5 minute interval. Then we need calculate the average steps across all days, whith is:
```{r echo=TRUE}

a <-length(levels(activity$date))
a

```
61 dayes. Thus the average steps across all days is:

```{r echo=TRUE}

ave_steps_byint <-total_steps_byint/61

```
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l"). 
```{r echo=TRUE}

ave_steps_byint1 <-as.ts(ave_steps_byint) 

plot.ts(ave_steps_byint1, xlab="Interval",ylab="Number_of_steps",type="l")


```

Figure 2  The averaged step for every 5-minute interval across all days. The x-axis is the number of the 5-minute interval, and the y-axis is the average number of steps taken in each interval and averaged across all 61 days.

### 2.Which 5-minute interval contains the maximum number of steps? ###
 
```{r echo=TRUE}

summary(ave_steps_byint)

```
On the average across all the days in the dataset,the maximum number of steps taken in 5-minute interval is about 68 (68.3).

```{r echo=TRUE}

max <-ave_steps_byint[,1]>68.311
ste_max <-ave_steps_byint[max,]
ste_max

```
And the maximum step happened on the interval of 1:55:00~2:00:00.

##Imputint missing values##
### 1.Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset.###
```{r echo=TRUE}

n_na <-mean(is.na(activity[,1]))
number_na <-n_na*nrow(activity)
n_na
number_na

```
In the column 1 of this data table, there is about 13.11% of missing values (NAs). The total number of NA is 2304.

###2.Filling in all of the missing values in the dataset by the mean for that 5-minute interval.###
First, we add an index to the dataframe

```{r echo=TRUE}

rname <-rownames(ave_steps_byint)
sum_df<-data.frame(sum_byint,row.names=c(1:288))
ave_byint <-data.frame(cbind(sum_df/61,rname))

```
Second, we do a "for loop" to replace NA's by the average value for that 5-minute interval.
```{r echo=TRUE}
n <-1:17568
m <-1:288
for (i in 1:length(n))
  {
    if (is.na(act_byinterval[i,1])==TRUE)
    {
      for(j in 1:length(m))
      {
        if (act_byinterval[i,3]==ave_byint[j,2])
       {act_byinterval[i,1] <-ave_byint[j,1]
        }
      }
    }
  }

```
###3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.###


```{r echo=TRUE}
activity_nNA <-arrange(act_byinterval,date,interval)

str(activity_nNA)

```
The date frame "activity_nNA" is same as original one but all the NA's have been replaced.

###4.Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day###
```{r echo=TRUE}
newstep_sum <-with(activity_nNA,tapply(activity_nNA[,1],activity_nNA[,2],sum))

newstep_df <-data.frame(newstep_sum)
newtotal_steps_bydate <-(newstep_df[,1])


hist(newtotal_steps_bydate)
```

Figure 3  Total number of steps taken each day with all the NA's have been replaced. 

By calculated the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{r echo=TRUE}
summary(newtotal_steps_bydate)
```
The results indicated that the values are differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment. 
```{r}
summary(total_steps_bydate)

```
The min., 1st Qu. values and even mean have been impacted by imputing missing data.  The median,3rd Qu and max. keeped same. 

##Calculate activity patterns between weekdays and weekends.##
###1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - "weekday" and "weekend" indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.###
First, add a column to the dataset, which with the filled-in missing values, that indicate the week days
```{r echo=TRUE}
wdays <-weekdays(as.Date(activity_nNA$date))
w_activity <-data.frame(mutate(activity_nNA,wdays))

```

Second, extract the weekend and weekday dataset. 
```{r echo=TRUE}
weekend_activity <-filter(w_activity,wdays=="Saturday"|wdays=="Sunday")

wday_activity <-filter(w_activity,wdays=="Monday"|wdays=="Tuesday"|wdays=="Wednesday"|wdays=="Thursday"|wdays=="Friday")
```
Calculate the total number of steps in each 5-minute interval for weekend and weekday respectivily.
```{r echo=TRUE}

sum_byint_weekend <-with(weekend_activity,tapply(weekend_activity[,1],weekend_activity[,3],sum, na.rm=TRUE))

sum_byint_wday <-with(wday_activity,tapply(wday_activity[,1],wday_activity[,3],sum, na.rm=TRUE))
```
###2.Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).###

Form a new dataset with both weekend and weekday average steps data each 5-minute interval.
```{r echo=TRUE}
d1 <-factor(weekend_activity[,2])
d2 <-factor(factor(wday_activity[,2]))
m1 <-length(levels(d1))
m2 <-length(levels(d2))


wday <-factor(c(rep("weekend",288), rep("weekday",288)))

ave_byint_weekend <-data.frame(sum_byint_weekend/m1)
colnames(ave_byint_weekend) <-"Number_of_steps"
ave_byint_wday <-data.frame(sum_byint_wday/m2)
colnames(ave_byint_wday) <-"Number_of_steps"
wst_ave_byint <-data.frame(rbind(ave_byint_weekend,ave_byint_wday))

interval<-as.numeric(c(row.names(ave_byint_wday), row.names(ave_byint_wday)))
wst_ave_byint1 <-data.frame(cbind(wst_ave_byint, interval,wday))
```
Make a panel plot 

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(lattice)
xyplot(Number_of_steps~interval|wday,wst_ave_byint1, type="l", layout=c(1,2))

```

Figure 4 The averaged step for every 5-minute interval averaged across all weekday days and weekend days (y-axis). The x-axis is the number of the 5-minute interval.
